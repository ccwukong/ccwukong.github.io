    <h1>Terms and Conditions for KopiBot Kit</h1>
    <p><em>Last Updated: September 28, 2025</em></p>

    <p>
      Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before using
      the kopibotkit.com website ("the Service") and upon purchasing the KopiBot
      Kit software ("the Product").
    </p>

    <h2>1. The Product</h2>
    <p>
      KopiBot Kit is a one-time purchase of a downloadable digital product,
      specifically a boilerplate codebase. It is not a Software-as-a-Service
      (SaaS) subscription. Your purchase grants you a license to use the code as
      outlined below.
    </p>

    <h2>2. License</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Starter License:</strong> Grants you the right to use KopiBot Kit
      to create one commercial end-product.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Pro License:</strong> Grants you the right to use KopiBot Kit to
      create unlimited commercial end-products.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are not permitted to resell, redistribute, or share the original
      KopiBot Kit codebase itself.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      The KopiBot Kit and its original content, features, and functionality are
      and will remain the exclusive property of the owner. You are granted a
      license to use the code to build your own applications, but not to claim
      ownership of the original boilerplate.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Pre-Orders</h2>
    <p>
      If you pre-order the Product, you will be charged at the time of the
      pre-order. We will make our best effort to deliver the Product by the
      estimated launch date. If, for any reason, the Product is not launched,
      you will receive a full refund of your pre-order payment.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      The Product is provided on an "as is" basis. In no event shall we be
      liable for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages arising out of
      the use or inability to use the Product. As the end-user, you are
      responsible for the security and maintenance of the code once you have
      downloaded and deployed it.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms shall be governed in accordance with the laws of the Republic
      of Singapore, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
