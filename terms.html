    <h1>Terms and Conditions for KopiBot Kit</h1>
    <p><em>Last Updated: September 28, 2025</em></p>

    <p>
      Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before using
      the kopibotkit.com website ("the Service") and before purchasing or
      requesting any products or services offered under the KopiBot Kit brand
      ("the Product", "the Service"). These Terms govern your purchase, license
      rights, and any optional professional services (for example, the
      White‑Glove Setup add-on).
    </p>

    <h2>1. The Product</h2>
    <p>
      KopiBot Kit is offered as a one-time purchase of a downloadable digital
      product: a boilerplate codebase and supporting documentation. KopiBot Kit
      is not provided as a recurring Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) subscription.
      All sales are one-time unless otherwise stated on the checkout page.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Pricing &amp; Purchase Flow</h2>
    <p>We sell KopiBot Kit using a two-step purchase flow:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1 — License Purchase</strong>: Choose a license tier for
        the codebase.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Starter</strong> — Retail price S$299 (Early Access: S$149)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pro</strong> — Retail price S$599 (Early Access: S$299)
          </li>
        </ul>
        The license purchase grants the rights described in Section 3 below.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2 — Optional White‑Glove Setup</strong>: An optional
        professional service that provides hands-on installation and basic
        configuration for an additional one-time fee of S$500.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      "Early Access" discounted rates are promotional, limited-time offers and
      may be ended or changed at any time. The price charged at checkout is the
      price that governs the transaction.
    </p>

    <h2>3. License</h2>
    <p>KopiBot Kit is licensed — not sold — subject to the following tiers.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Starter License:</strong> Grants a non-exclusive, non-transferable
      license to use KopiBot Kit to create one (1) commercial end-product. You
      may modify the code for your use, deploy it, and distribute the compiled
      application to your customers as part of that single end-product.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Pro License:</strong> Grants a non-exclusive, non-transferable
      license to use KopiBot Kit to create unlimited commercial end-products.
      The Pro license permits you to reuse the code across projects you build
      for your organization or clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Restrictions:</strong> You may not resell, redistribute,
      sublicense, or share the original KopiBot Kit source code itself. You may
      not claim ownership of the original boilerplate. Embedding the code within
      your commercial offering (compiled/minified) as part of a product you sell
      is permitted within the limits of your purchased license tier.
    </p>

    <h2>4. White‑Glove Setup (Optional Service)</h2>
    <p>
      The White‑Glove Setup is an optional professional service sold as an
      add-on to the license purchase. It is a one-time service priced at S$500
      and typically includes up to 4 hours of hands-on installation and basic
      configuration (for example: environment setup, first deploy, and
      onboarding walkthrough). Any additional hours or bespoke work beyond the
      standard scope will be quoted and invoiced separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scheduling: White‑Glove work is scheduled after the service purchase is
      confirmed. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule the
      work within 30 days of purchase, subject to availability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refunds &amp; Cancellations: Because White‑Glove Setup is a time-bound
      professional service, it is refundable if cancelled more than 48 hours
      before the scheduled start. Once the work has begun, the service fee is
      non-refundable. If we fail to deliver the promised White‑Glove work, we
      will provide either a full refund of the White‑Glove fee or a re-schedule
      at no additional cost, at our discretion.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Pre-Orders &amp; Refunds</h2>
    <p>
      If you pre-order the Product, you will be charged at the time of the
      pre-order. We will make our best effort to deliver the Product by the
      estimated launch date. If, for any reason, the Product is not launched,
      you will receive a full refund of your pre-order payment. For digital
      downloads, we cannot offer refunds after the product files have been
      downloaded or access has been granted, except in limited circumstances
      discussed case-by-case (for example, demonstrable failure to deliver the
      purchased files).
    </p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      The KopiBot Kit and its original content, features, and functionality are
      and will remain the exclusive property of the owner. You are granted a
      license to use the code to build your own applications, but not to claim
      ownership of the original boilerplate.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      The Product is provided on an "as is" basis. In no event shall we be
      liable for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages arising out of
      the use or inability to use the Product. As the end-user, you are
      responsible for the security and maintenance of the code once you have
      downloaded and deployed it.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms shall be governed in accordance with the laws of the Republic
      of Singapore, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
